// Program three simple classes which keep track of the grading of a sample student. 
// The classes are called BooleanCourse, GradedCourse, and Project.
// A BooleanCourse encapsulates a course name and a registration of passed/not passed for students.
// A GradedCourse encapsulates a course name and the grade of the student. The grade 5 is the lowest passing grade.
// In both BooleanCourse and GradedCourse you should write a method called Passed.
// The method is supposed to return whether our sample student passes the course.
// The class Project aggregates two boolean courses and two graded courses. 
// You can assume that a project is passed if at least three out of the four courses are passed.
